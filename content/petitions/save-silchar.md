The Barak River, which had been swelling after incessant rainfall, flows along Silchar town. On Sunday, the river breached an embankment six kilometres upstream, at Bethukandi and by Monday, the town was submerged.

Since April, the death toll due to floods and landslides in Assam crossed 100. Over 5.4 lakh people in 32 of 36 districts of Assam have been impacted. There has been a slight improvement in the overall flood situation in Assam since Wednesday. But large sections of Silchar, the second largest city in the flood-ravaged state is under water and rescue operations continue, with stranded residents being taken to safety.
