The felling of trees in the foothills of Shivalik would lead to dry climate and increase global warming. The likelihood of precipitation and rainfall increases by 6-7% for every 1Ö¯C rise in mean temperature. The forest is open as well as dense mixed sal forest, the only forest link between Shiwalik and Himalayan Ranges in the valley and habitat of over 104 bird species.
