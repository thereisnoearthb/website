**Details on the event**: 

Sanjay Van, a reserve forest, a very essential part of the lives of Delhiites is in danger!

Our decision makers have been recklessly enabling the exploitation of Sanjay Van in the name of development and economy. The government is planning to hold conferences, open a restaurant in Sanjay Van and rebrand the forest as a park which will not only harm animals, trees, insects, and birds but will also lead to an increase in pollution levels and deforestation.

To raise awareness and protect Sanjay Van, we the active stakeholders of the forest, are organizing a poster-making activity this Sunday, **3rd July 2022.**

We cordially invite you to participate and advocate for the cause.
