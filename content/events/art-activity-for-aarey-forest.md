### Event Information

*Project Title*: Waste-to-Art Activity for Aarey Forest

*Date*: 9th July 2022

*Location*: Pune

*Details on the event*: 

Aarey Forest is a rich urban forest which is within the eco sensitive zone of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Mumbai. The government is implementing Mumbaiâ€™s first fully underground Metro corridor -- Metro Line-3 -- running from Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ and is planning a car shed inside the Aarey Forest.

To raise awareness and protect this forest, a fun waste-to-art activity was organized on 9th July 2022 in Pune. It was a small event where glass bottles were painted and bird water feeders were made from single-use plastic water bottles. Art was made from waste to spread awareness.
