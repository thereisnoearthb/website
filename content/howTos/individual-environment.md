## Steps

#### 1. Say NO to single-use plastic and YES to eco-friendly products. 
_(yes this sounds like something we all know but just switching to these habits can make a huge difference)_ <br/> Here are some things that you can do :) 
You are meeting your friends for lunch? Restaurants usually provide with plastic water bottles. Aw crap! A recent report revealed that your body absorbs chemicals added to plastics and we are already aware of the dangers of microplastics! _(if you want to know more, here's the link-> [click here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/08/microplastics-damage-human-cells-study-plastic))._ Considering their harmful nature, these factors can have a resultant negative effect on our bodies. Plastic debris has the potential to injure and poison wildlife with the daunting possibility of leaching harmful chemicals into groundwater when disposed of in landfills. You lead the way, choose your eco-friendly reusable bottle and don't forget to stay hydrated <3 

#### 2. Do you love cooking? learn to love leftovers too!
#### 3. Get to know upcycling
#### 4. Prefer local food
#### 5. Prefer eating plant-based foods
